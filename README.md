Project developed in the Back-end Module at the [Trybe](https://www.betrybe.com/) course.

### 🎯
The project goal was to apply SOLID and OOP principles in a Role Playing Game - RPG. <br>

The goal was practice the following habilities:
 * the Object-Oriented Programming - OOP principles: Polymorphism, Encapsulation, Data Abstraction and Inheritance
 * TypeScript implementations of classes and interfaces.

<br>

## ⚔️**Contextualizing**
In  Trybers and Dragons - T&D universe almost all beings belong to a specific race.<br>
The races define the caracters features as life points and strength. But there is bestial beings without a race, they are called monsters.<br>
Some beings have energy and by training this energy they receive an archetype that determine their personalities, habilities and world vision.<br>
This universe can be dangerous and some times this beings fight battles.
